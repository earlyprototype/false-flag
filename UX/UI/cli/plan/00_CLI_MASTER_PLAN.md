## 🚨 Risk Management

### Current Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Modal overlay pattern feels clunky | Medium | User testing, consider hybrid approach |
| Dashboard breaks original CLI | High | Never modify `cli/main.py` directly |
| Timeline slips beyond 5 days | Medium | Focus on Phase 1 fixes first, defer enhancements |
| DEFCON colours too intense | Low | Keep theme switcher, gather feedback |
