/**
 * automerge-eligible.cjs — the auto-merge eligibility gate (ADR-035, amending
 * ADR-034; severity threshold tightened by ADR-037).
 *
 * WHAT ELIGIBILITY MEANS NOW. ADR-034 gated auto-merge by a default-deny PATH
 * ALLOWLIST: only routine docs auto-merged and ALL code stayed manual. ADR-035
 * loosens that — a pull request is eligible to auto-merge once its REVIEW VERDICT
 * is clean (CI green + no CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM review finding + conversations
 * resolved), code included. (ADR-035 originally let MEDIUMs pass; ADR-037 added
 * MEDIUM to the blocking set after PR #135 auto-merged carrying two MEDIUMs —
 * only LOW and informational notes pass now.) The path allowlist is dropped as
 * the gate; the review verdict IS the gate. So this file no longer classifies
 * file paths — it classifies the reviewer's verdict.
 *
 * TWO CALLERS, ONE VERDICT (ADR-035 + its 1 July 2026 follow-up). This classifier
 * is the single source of truth for "is this review clean?", read by BOTH gates:
 *   1. the `review` required status check (.github/workflows/claude-pr-review.yml)
 *      — a BLOCK exit fails the check and holds the merge; and
 *   2. the ARMING workflow (.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml) — which arms GitHub's
 *      native auto-merge ONLY when this classifier returns PASS for the review run.
 * The hosted reviewer is told to end its review with exactly one machine-readable
 * line:
 *     AUTOMERGE_VERDICT: PASS    (no CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM findings)
 *     AUTOMERGE_VERDICT: BLOCK   (at least one CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM finding)
 * A caller pipes that review text into this script; a BLOCK exit fails the `review`
 * check (caller 1) and refuses to arm (caller 2), and the MainLCCL branch ruleset
 * (empty bypass) then holds the merge. That is what makes a CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM
 * finding block the merge MECHANICALLY, not merely as a posted comment — the gap
 * ADR-035 closes. The severity-to-verdict mapping itself lives in the reviewer's
 * prompt (claude-pr-review.yml); this classifier reads only the verdict line.
 *
 * SKIP IS NOT PASS. When claude-code-action self-skips (on a PR that edits the
 * review workflow) it posts NO review, so the text handed here is empty — which is
 * BLOCK, not PASS. This is the load-bearing property behind the arming fix: a
 * skipped review can never be "eligible", so auto-merge.yml never arms on a skip
 * (the gap that let PR #134 auto-merge unseen). The `review` check still goes green
 * on skip by a SEPARATE branch in claude-pr-review.yml (so a human can merge) — that
 * greenness is not routed through this classifier, and must not be mistaken for one.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, like its predecessor and its sibling .claude/hooks/review-gate.cjs:
 *   - no verdict line rendered   -> BLOCK (a review that did not render a verdict
 *                                   cannot clear a merge)
 *   - reviewer skipped / empty   -> BLOCK (a skip is not a clean review)
 *   - any BLOCK line present     -> BLOCK (block wins over any PASS)
 *   - empty / non-string input   -> BLOCK
 * Only an unambiguous PASS (>= 1 PASS line, no BLOCK line) is eligible.
 *
 * A verdict is read only from a LINE whose content is the marker (after stripping
 * surrounding markdown decoration). That keeps a marker QUOTED inside prose — an
 * instruction the reviewer might echo, or a sentence about the format — from being
 * mistaken for the verdict itself.
 *
 * Pure core: verdictOf(text) -> 'PASS'|'BLOCK', isEligible(text) -> boolean,
 * markersIn(text) -> ('PASS'|'BLOCK')[]. Node builtins only.
 * CLI (require.main === module): reads the review text from STDIN, prints a
 * one-line reason to stderr, exits 0 (eligible / PASS) or 1 (block).
